Issue tracking
uses GitHubâ€™s tracker called Issues for easy collaboration among developers to keep track of tasks, enhancements, and bugs during software sprints. A typical issue looks like this:

A title and description describe what the issue is all about.
Color-coded labels help you categorize and filter your issues (just like labels in email).
A milestone acts like a container for issues. This is useful for associating a group of issues with specific features or time period (e.g. Weekly Sprint 9/7-7/20 or PWA 1.0).
One assignee is responsible for working on the issue at any given time.
